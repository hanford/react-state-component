# react-state-component
> render function that exposes an additional external state

[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

### Usage

```sh
$ npm install react-state-component --save
```

```js
import State from 'react-state-component'

...

<State initial={{ count: 0 }}>
  {({ state, setState }) => (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>The count is: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count + 1 })}>Add</button>
      <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count - 1 })}>Remove</button>
    </Fragment>
  )}
</State>
```

Alternatively you could use a render prop

```js
import State from 'react-state-component'

...

<State
  initial={{ count: 0 }}
  render={({ state, setState }) => (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>The count is: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count + 1 })}>Add</button>
      <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count - 1 })}>Remove</button>
    </Fragment>
  )}
/>
```
